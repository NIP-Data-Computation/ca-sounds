# ca-sounds

These are the resulting sounds from Roselle Mae M. Menchavez' BS Thesis entitled **Sound Synthesis with the Totalistic Rule Celullar Automata**.

1. The sounds that are made with varying states, k = 4 to 10, are in [varying states](https://github.com/NIP-Data-Computation/ca-sounds/tree/main/varying%20states) folder. All of the sounds there have the rules consecutive ascending depending on the base equivalent with its respective states.

2. The sounds that are made with varying rules: ascending, descending, consecutive ascending, and ascending descending. All of the rules have k = 10, for its state. They can be found on the [varying rules](https://github.com/NIP-Data-Computation/ca-sounds/tree/main/varying%20rules). 

These files are open to the public and can be used for your own, if you want to show these results elsewhere. Just please don't claim it as your own <3
